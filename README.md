In this video, I have covered three simple steps to quickly deploy your **JSON Server** on render.com.

Three Simple Steps:

1. Create a repository from the template.
2. Add your own data.
3. Deploy it.

Believe me, this is the **easiest way** to deploy your JSON server on render.com. Deploy your db.json file without writing a **single line of code**.
